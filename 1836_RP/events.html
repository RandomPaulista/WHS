  <h3>Central American Collapse and the Mexican Rebels</h3>
  <div class="treaty-meta">1841 | Affected: British Empire, United States and New Granada</div>
  <p>
The Federation of Central America has fractured beyond repair. From 1839 to 1841, civil war and secessionist revolts tore the Union apart. The conservative republics of Costa Rica, Nicaragua, and Honduras/Comayagua declared their independence from the federal government, which, long dominated by Guatemala, was unable to maintain cohesion. Even San Salvador, once a loyalist stronghold, eventually seceded from the union. In the highlands, the short-lived state of Los Altos rose in rebellion, dreaming of federal revival — but was swiftly crushed. By the end of 1839, the Federal Republic was a memory. <br>
To the north, Mexico faces a wave of internal collapse. Defeat in the Mexican-American War has left the state humiliated and broken. Rebel groups rise in Sonora, Chihuahua, the Rio Grande, and the Yucatán, while liberal Federalist factions challenge the conservative centralist government in Mexico City. <br>
Guatemala, from its current success and the Mexican crisis, moves to annex Chiapas, reigniting old territorial disputes.

  <h3>Collapse of the Peru-Bolivian Confederation</h3>
  <div class="treaty-meta">1841 | Affected: Bolivia</div>
  <p>
The Peru-Bolivian Confederation, once hailed as the great hope of Andean unity, has crumbled. Established in 1836 by Marshal Andrés de Santa Cruz, the confederation sought to unite North Peru, South Peru, and Bolivia under a federated republican mode, but its foundation was fragile. <br>
By 1840, after a fierce war of independence, the alliance fell apart. Backed by Argentina, the governments of North and South Peru rose in rebellion against Santa Cruz's authority. After the decisive defeat of confederal forces, the Peruvian republics declared victory and reunification under a single banner. <br>
With Peru reborn, the confederal project is dead. <br>
Meanwhile, Bolivia lies in political ruin, its central government weakened, its departments fractured, and its military demoralised. Caudillos and loyalists to Santa Cruz vie for power, as neighbouring powers look on.
