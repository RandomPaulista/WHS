  <h3>Acehnese Offensive</h3>

  <p>
    The Sultanate of Aceh took the lead in declaring jihad against Dutch and British colonial rule in Southeast Asia. Acehnese forces launched raids across the Strait of Malacca, inspiring unrest among independent Malay states in Borneo, Sumatra, Sulawesi, and Malacca.  
    Though these rebel groups have not yet fully joined the fight, tensions are rising across the region. The Dutch have deployed troops to try and contain the growing insurgency, but the conflict is far from settled.
