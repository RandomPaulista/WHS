  <h1>Jihad Declarations</h1>

  <div class="treaty-post">
    <h3>Ottoman Empire</h3>
    <p>
      The Ottomans avoided formally declaring jihad, framing the war instead as an anti-colonial resistance.
      Their reluctance to call for jihad left a vacuum that local scholars and leaders quickly filled.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="treaty-post">
    <h3>Hejaz</h3>
    <p>
      The scholars of Mecca saw the Ottoman message as cowardly. They issued a direct declaration of jihad, calling the war a spiritual obligation.
      Their words became the rallying cry for Muslims from the Atlantic to the Indies.
      WIth assistance from Nejd and Yemen, they organized a united front against the Egyptians.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="treaty-post">
    <h3>Yemen & Nejd</h3>
    <p>
      Aden, other Southern Yemeni tribes and Wahhabi Nejd accepted the Meccan call with zeal, framing the conflict as a divine war.
      Northern Shia Yemen rejected the movement. The southern tribes fight to restore religious purity and defend Arabia.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="treaty-post">
    <h3>Levant & Mesopotamia</h3>
    <p>
      Inspired by Mecca, scholars and townsfolk revolted against local garrisons.
      The Levantines saw Egypt's tolerance of non-Muslims as heresy and joined the wider jihad to purify governance.
      The Mesopotamians, long oppressed by Ottoman rule, saw this as a chance to reclaim their lands and fend off the British.
      Many of the Levantine Egyptian troops and Mesopotamian Ottoman troops joined the rebellion, seeing it as a chance to fight for their faith and homeland.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="treaty-post">
    <h3>Sudan & Horn of Africa</h3>
    <p>
      Sufi orders declared the war a cleansing of foreign influence. Egypt's betrayal pushed them into full rebellion.
      Mahdist-like movements called for the overthrow of all corrupt Muslim rulers.
      The Sudanese seek Independence from Ottoman and Egyptian rule, while the Somalis aim to expel the christian Ethiopians.
    </p>
  </div>

<div class="treaty-post">
  <h3>Tunis and Tripolitania</h3>
  <p>
    Cut off from Constantinople by enemy blockades and invasion, the local ulama and tribal sheikhs declared jihad independently.
    They rejected both European domination and the Ottomans' passive stance, calling for an Islamic revival free from foreign rule.
    Their struggle aims not just to defend their lands, but to forge a new path for the Maghrebâ€”without Istanbul or Rome.
    They stole ottoman troops to invade Egypt and defend their Homeland
  </p>
</div>

  <div class="treaty-post">
    <h3>Maghreb</h3>
    <p>
      The Ottoman framing was embraced but deemed insufficient. Morocco declared jihad formally, uniting with tribal resistance in Algeria.
      Their fight is against European invaders and in defense of Islam's western frontiers.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="treaty-post">
    <h3>Oman, Zanzibar & Trucial Coast</h3>
    <p>
      These coastal powers aligned with the Meccan call. Imams declared jihad against imperial trade networks, especially British-aligned ports.
      The struggle is economic, religious, and cultural.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="treaty-post">
    <h3>Caucasus & Central Asia</h3>
    <p>
      Local Sufi leaders viewed the Ottoman call as weak but saw the Meccan declaration as justification to resume jihad against Russia.
      They aim to defend their mountains and steppe from Christian encroachment.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="treaty-post">
    <h3>Afghanistan, Kalat, Sindh & Sikh Response</h3>
    <p>
      The Afghans saw both Ottoman and Meccan messages as divine signs. They launched a full jihad against British occupiers.
      Kalat and Sindh followed in revolt. The Sikh Empire Muslims remained cautious, preparing for possible further conflict.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="treaty-post">
    <h3>Indian Muslims</h3>
    <p>
      Indian Muslims saw the Meccan call as a reason to rise. Uprisings began in the Deccan and Awadh, spreading to Bengal, Delhi and Arakan, not in loyalty to the Ottomans,
      but in defense of their faith under colonial oppression.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="treaty-post">
    <h3>Malayan Archipelago</h3>
    <p>
      The Acehnese had already been fighting the Dutch. The Meccan message unified the islands into a wider struggle.
      From Java to the Sulu Sea, Muslims began organizing rebellion against colonial powers.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="treaty-post">
    <h3>Jabal Shammar & Inner Arabia</h3>
    <p>
      Jabal Shammar saw Mecca's khutbah as divine validation.
      Their emir declared jihad both against Western-aligned rulers and the Ottoman court, accusing them of betraying Islam's guardianship.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="treaty-post">
    <h3>Persia</h3>
    <p>
      The Persian Shiite clergy rejected both the Ottoman narrative and the Meccan uprising,
      viewing the movement as a Sunni insurrection. Persia remains neutral but wary.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="treaty-post">
    <h3>What this means?</h3>
    <p>
      The Meccan declaration of jihad has transformed the conflict into a pan-Islamic struggle.
      From North Africa to Southeast Asia, Muslims are rising against colonial powers and perceived apostasy.
      The Ottomans' failure to lead has fractured the Islamic world, with local movements taking up the mantle of jihad.
    </p>
    <div class="treaty-meta">For the Ottomans</div>
    <p>
      The Ottomans now face a multifaceted jihad that has spread across their empire and beyond.
      Their initial reluctance to declare jihad has backfired, as local leaders and scholars have taken up the call.
      The Ottomans must now decide whether to fully embrace the jihad narrative, and lose control in Europe, or risk losing control over the Muslim world.
    </p>
    <div class="treaty-meta">For the Coalitioners</div>
    <p>
      The Coalitioners must navigate a web of local uprisings and jihadist movements.
      The Coalitioners will need to adapt their strategies to counter this widespread insurgency, which threatens their interests.
    </p>
    <div class="treaty-meta">For the Mujahideen</div>
    <p>
      The Mujahideen are now only missing a unified command to coordinate their efforts.
      They have the potential to become a formidable force, but their lack of coordination and resources may hinder their effectiveness.
    </p>
