    <h3>Tunisian and Tripolitanian Invasions</h3>
    <div class="treaty-meta">Tunis and Tripoli Repel Italy</div>
    <p>
      After declaring independence from the Ottomans and seizing local garrisons, the governments of Tunis and Tripolitania turned their attention to the pressing threat: the Italian landings on the North African coast.
      Rather than pushing into Egypt as the Ottomans demanded, they prioritized expelling the invaders. Italian forces were pushed back into the sea.

    <div class="treaty-meta">Advance Toward Alexandria</div>
    <p>
      After the repulsion of Italy, Tripolitanian troops advanced eastward into Egyptian territory. With most of Egypt's forces committed in the Levant, the western frontier proved vulnerable.
      Although Tripolitania claimed much of the borderlands, the Egyptian army managed to stabilize the front near Alexandria.

    <div class="treaty-meta">Tlemcen Falls</div>
    <p>
      The Moroccan army launched an invasion of western Algeria, quickly capturing the city of Tlemcen. The local population, disillusioned with French rule, largely welcomed the Moroccan forces.
      France, underestimating the scope of the incursion, sent only small garrisons, allowing the Moroccans to entrench themselves with minimal resistance.

  <h3>Levantine and Mesopotamian Rebellions</h3>
  <div class="treaty-meta">Ottomans and Egyptians Turn Inward</div>
  <p>
    The Ottoman Empire and Egypt, both distracted by external wars, were forced to halt their campaigns as rebellion erupted within their own ranks. 
    Entire units in the Levant and Mesopotamia mutinied, turning their weapons on their commanders and declaring loyalty to the Meccan-led jihad. 
    Both states redirected their forces inward, attempting to suppress the uprisings â€” but the sheer scale and religious fervor of the insurgents made this impossible.

    <h3>Yemen and Nejd's Religious Mobilization</h3>
    <div class="treaty-meta">Hejazi Independence</div>
    <p>
        The scholars of Mecca, seeing the Ottomans' reluctance to formally declare jihad, took matters into their own hands. They issued a direct call to arms, framing the war as a spiritual obligation for all Muslims.
        This declaration galvanized support across the Islamic world, with Yemen and Nejd joining forces to organize a united front against the Egyptians.

    <h3>Sudanese and Horn of Africa Uprisings</h3>
    <div class="treaty-meta">Somalis Lead Rebellion and Invasion</div>
    <p>
        Sufi orders in Sudan and the Horn of Africa declared the war a cleansing of foreign influence. Egypt's betrayal pushed them into full rebellion, leading to widespread uprisings against Egyptian rule.
        The Sufi leaders framed their struggle as a divine war, rallying support from local tribes and communities.
        The Somalis interpreted the call to jihad as a chance to expel the Christian Ethiopians from their lands, while Sudanese tribes sought independence from both Ottoman and Egyptian rule.

  <h3>Persian Gulf</h3>
  <div class="treaty-meta">British Invasion of Kuwait</div>
  <p>
    As British forces prepared to launch an ambitious landing in Kuwait, the region erupted. 
    The Trucial States declared jihad, viewing the British presence as a direct threat to Islam and sovereignty.
    Oman quickly followed, cutting off vital naval access and choking British logistics in the Gulf. <br>
    Though the British forced their way through with superior naval firepower, they suffered heavily.
    Many vessels were burned or seized along the coast, and soldiers were picked off by coordinated tribal and mujahideen attacks.
    By the time they reached Kuwait, the exhausted invaders met fierce Mesopotamian resistance, organized and dug in from previous uprisings.
    The British force was routed. The invasion had failed. <br>
    On the flip side, the British managed to secure Persian neutrality and military passage.

  <h3>Zanzibar and the Indian Ocean</h3>
  <div class="treaty-meta">Seychelles seized from the British</div>
  <p>
    The British struggled to maintain control over their Indian Ocean territories. 
    The Sultanate of Zanzibar, emboldened by the jihad's call, launched a surprise attack on the Seychelles, seizing the islands with minimal resistance.
    The British garrison, caught off guard and outnumbered, surrendered quickly. This victory boosted Zanzibar's prestige and influence in the region.
