  <h1>Balkan and Eurasian Fronts</h1>

  <div class="treaty-post">
    <h3>Bessarabia and the Caucasus</h3>
    <div class="treaty-meta">Ottoman Occupation of the Caucasus and Bessarabia</div>
    <p>
      With Russian troops stationed along the southern frontier but paralyzed by indecision, the Ottomans seized the moment.
      Ottoman forces launched a bold and calculated offensive across the Prut River into Bessarabia, capturing minor towns and fortresses before the Russians could even respond.
      The absence of Russian resistance turned it into a rapid advance.<br>
      In the Caucasus, Ottoman-aligned tribal leaders and Sufi clerics rose up in rebellion. Ottoman regulars pushed through the Armenian highlands while Dagestani, Chechen, and Circassian mujahideen surged from the mountains, overrunning Tsarist outposts.
      Russian morale in the region collapsed as commanders waited fruitlessly for orders from St. Petersburg.<br>
      By the end of 1843, Ottoman banners flew deep inside Bessarabia and the Caucasian foothills.

    <h3>Central Asia</h3>
    <div class="treaty-meta">Kazakh Seizure of the Lower Volga</div>
    <p>
      Responding to the Meccan call, Kazakh tribes launched swift raids into Tsarist territory.
      With Russian forces inactive, the steppe warriors overran the lower Volga and sacked key outposts from Astrakhan to Volgograd.
      Russian control in the region collapsed as Kazakh banners rose along the riverbanks.

    <h3>Illyrian and Danube Fronts</h3>
    <div class="treaty-meta">Stalemate Across the Balkan Line</div>
    <p>
      Despite being outnumbered, Ottoman forces held their ground along the Danube and in the hills of Dalmatia, pushing back Austria's advance. Heavy clashes erupted in Belgrade, where Austrian cavalry and artillery attempted to break through Ottoman lines.
      The Ottomans strategically collapsed key bridges across the Danube and Sava, stalling Austrian reinforcements and disrupting their supply chains. Although Austria secured some crossings over the Sava, direct assaults on Belgrade ultimately failed.
      Austria managed to seize limited ground in Northern Bosnia and Oltenia, but the offensive stalled in Dalmatia and Herzegovina, where mountainous terrain and Ottoman counterattacks near Mostar inflicted heavy casualties.
      By the end of the year, both sides were exhausted and locked in a bloody sstalemate, with no decisive gains achieved.

  <h3>Italian Invasion of Albania</h3>
  <div class="treaty-meta">Italo-Turkish Coastal Standoff</div>
  <p>
    Italian forces launched an invasion of Albania, landing near Durrës and Vlorë and quickly seizing control of the coastline. Supported by naval assets from Corfu, they fortified major ports and established a strong maritime presence. 
    However, Ottoman forces had entrenched themselves inland, falling back to mountain strongholds and key strategic passes. Reinforcements from other fronts arrived swiftly, bolstering the interior defences and stalling Italian advances beyond the coast. 
    Clashes erupted in the foothills as Italy attempted to push eastward, but the rugged terrain and determined resistance prevented any significant breakthrough.
